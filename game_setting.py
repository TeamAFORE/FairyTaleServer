There is no grudge between you and the wolf. You heard that I saw a wolf trying to eat my grandmother the other day when I went to her house on my mom's errand. I'm so angry that I'm going to take revenge on the wolf. But I can't go alone, so I want to persuade you and get revenge together.",

You dated a wolf, but you broke up because of the difference in food taste. You heard that I saw a wolf trying to eat my grandmother the other day when I went to her house on my mom's errand. I'm so angry that I'm going to take revenge on the wolf. But I can't go alone, so I want to persuade you and get revenge together.",

You're worried about your family because you're making a family, and you're afraid you'll get injured when you go get revenge on the wolf.
